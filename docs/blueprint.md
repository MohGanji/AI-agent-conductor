# AI Agent Orchestration System Blueprint

## 1. Overview
This document defines the blueprint for an AI Agent Orchestration System that enables multiple autonomous AI agents to run concurrently with sandboxed execution environments, independent memory, and configurable inter-agent communication. It covers system goals, architecture, agent design, communication protocols, interrupt handling, monitoring, and a high-level roadmap.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Enable running multiple AI agents (e.g. OpenAI Codex, Claude Code) in parallel.
- Provide each agent with:
  - A clear rule set (DSL or markdown-based rules file).
  - An isolated sandbox for code execution, tests, and scripts.
  - Persistent note-taking (memory) files as a second brain.
  - Defined instructions, blueprint, and goals.
- Agents should not be able to access or update each other's sandbox, memory, or files.
- Support flexible synchronous and asynchronous communication channels between agents.
- Implement interrupt mechanisms for user input, debugging, or stalls.
- Offer real-time visibility and control over agent activities, messaging, and state.

**TODO:** Define success metrics and SLAs for agent performance and reliability.

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture

### 3.1 Agents
Each agent consists of:
1. **Descriptor & Metadata**: ID, type, description, responsibilities.
2. **Rules Engine**: Markdown or DSL-based rules (e.g. similar to Cursor rules or Claude rules).
3. **Execution Sandbox**: Containerized or jailed environment for running code, tests, and scripts.
4. **Memory Store**: Local note file or structured storage acting as persistent memory.
5. **Instruction & Blueprint Input**: Initial parameters, goals, and blueprint reference.
6. **Communication Interface**: APIs/queues for sending and receiving messages. (Will use Temporal workflows and activities)

### 3.2 Orchestration Config (agents.yaml / agents.json)
Define agents and communication topology in a single configuration file. Example (YAML):
```yaml
agents:
  - id: dev-agent
    type: codex
    description: "Software developer agent responsible for implementing features"
    responsibilities: [
        "Implement modules for feature X",
        "Make changes on the implementation when requirements change",
        ]
    rules_file: ./agents/dev-agent/rules.md
    memory_file: ./agents/dev-agent/memory.md
    sandbox_path: ./agents/dev-agent/sandbox
    direct_communication: [
        "test-agent",
    ]
    initial_instructions: |
      Implement feature X according to the blueprint.

  - id: test-agent
    type: codex
    description: "Software tester agent that validates code correctness"
    responsibilities: [
        "Run test suite and report failures.",
        "Write unit tests based on software design and requirements.",
        "Update unit tests when code is updated.",
    ]
    rules_file: ./agents/test-agent/rules.md
    memory_file: ./agents/test-agent/memory.md
    sandbox_path: ./agents/test-agent/sandbox
    initial_instructions: |
      Run test suite and report failures.
  - id: product-owner-agent
    type: codex
    description: "Product owner agent that defines features and requirements"
    responsibilities: [
        "Define features and requirements for the software.",
        "Update features and requirements when they change.",
        "Review the tests to ensure they reflect the requirements.",
        "Run the tests and ensure the implementation is correct.",
    ]
    rules_file: ./agents/product-owner-agent/rules.md
    memory_file: ./agents/product-owner-agent/memory.md
    sandbox_path: ./agents/product-owner-agent/sandbox
    initial_instructions: |
      Define features and requirements for the software.
```
**TODO:** Finalize JSON Schema / YAML spec for validation.

### 3.3 Agent Lifecycle & Messaging
1. **Initialization**: Read descriptor, rules, memory, and instructions.
2. **Execution Loop**:
   - Observe memory and new messages.
   - Plan next action(s).
   - Execute in sandbox.
   - Update memory and send messages via configured channels.
3. **Communication Modes**:
   - **Synchronous**: Sender blocks until receiver acknowledges/responds.
   - **Asynchronous**: Fire-and-forget, sender continues immediately.
4. **Termination**: Agent completes tasks or receives shutdown signal.

**TODO:** Define message envelope schema (headers, payload, reply_to).

---

## 4. Interrupt Handling
- Agents can emit interrupts of types:
  - **user_input**: Need clarification or decision from user.
  - **debug_request**: Stuck or errors in execution.
  - **progress_report**: Summaries at checkpoints.
- Orchestrator captures interrupts and surfaces them in the UI.
- User can respond to resume, modify instructions, or cancel operations.

**TODO:** Specify interrupt API and UI flows.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Observability
- Leverage [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) for workflow orchestration and visibility.
- Key UI components:
  - **Agent Dashboard**: Displays status (running, idle, waiting), memory snippets, current task.
  - **Message Log**: Real-time view of messages passing between agents.
  - **Interrupt Panel**: List of active interrupts and user actions.
  - **Sandbox Console**: Live logs of code execution for each agent.

**TODO:** Create wireframes for the above components.

---

## 6. Technical Stack & Infrastructure
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI Codex (open source), Claude Code (evaluate licensing).
- **Orchestration**: Temporal workflows and queues.
- **Sandboxing**: Docker containers or lightweight VMs; resource limits and security policies.
- **Persistence**: Filesystem for memory, optional database for indexing and search.
- **UI**: React + Temporal UI + custom components.
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python microservices exposing agent runtime and orchestration APIs.

**TODO:** Choose primary programming language and framework.

---

## 7. Security & Isolation
- Enforce container boundaries and least-privilege principles.
- Network policies to isolate sandboxes.
- Validate and sanitize all messages and code before execution.

**TODO:** Draft security guidelines and compliance requirements.

---

## 8. Roadmap & Milestones
1. **M1**: Single-agent prototype with sandbox and memory.
2. **M2**: Multi-agent orchestration with basic async messaging.
3. **M3**: Add synchronous channels and confirmation workflows.
4. **M4**: Implement interrupt handling and user UI integration.
5. **M5**: Integrate Temporal for robust monitoring.
6. **M6**: Performance optimization, security hardening, and documentation.

---

## Appendix & Next Steps
- **Glossary**: Define key terms (agent, interrupt, sandbox, workflow).
- **References**: Links to Temporal, Cursor rules examples, Claude rules.
- **TODO**: Gather stakeholder requirements and refine blueprint based on feedback.
